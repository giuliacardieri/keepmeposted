# Keep Me Posted
A web application developed in PHP and MySQL to manage a postcard collection.

# Why a postcard collection?
There's a project called Postcrossing (http://postcrossing.com). It's an awesome project that I joined in 2006. 
After 9 years I have a lot of postcards and I'm really passionate about collecting them :D
Creating a system to manage them is something I always wanted to do since I started my Computer Science degree.

# Is it finished?
Every feature on the project is working. Right now I consider it a demo. Anyone can edit/add/delete postcards.
I plan to improve it adding a login page and allowing everyone who wants to manage their postcard collection to have a database.

# How you developed it?
It was created using HTML5, CSS3 with Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL.
It is responsive.

# Can I add a postcard just to say "hey giulia?""
Sure :D Go ahead and test it!
